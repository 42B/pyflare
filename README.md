Updates Cloudflare with current IP

So I got sick of all those free dynamic dns services and thought I'd do something else. Cloudflare will host your DNS for free, on top of a whole heap of other benefits, and they have a really good API for updating DNS records. The idea is that you run this script like you would a dynamic DNS client - it's python so entirely cross platform and uses minimal and very common libraries.
